# DB-classes
The repository includes two projects created for Databases' classes at my university. Solutions were written in T-SQL and C# languages.

Every project contains a report providing an explanation to the solution. The topics of the projects are:
  1. "A Web application with database access", <br />
A C# Web application connected to a database using Entity Framework Core and Razor pages. <br />

  2. "A database for transport management". <br />
A database with multiple SQL DDL, DML and DQL instructions as well as indexes, transactions and a stored procedure on different isolation levels.
